Run Arduino code on windows or linux

What is WinUno?
WinUno is a way of compiling arduino code into a windows executable.
It is ideal for testing code without the arduino board.
Since Delphi language was easy for me to write the code it will only
Work with C++ Builder.
WinUno is not perfect. To convert Arduino code into WinUno code use
inoconv.exe file
